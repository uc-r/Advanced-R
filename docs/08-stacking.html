# Common ensemble methods

&lt;br&gt;
.font110[
* Ensemble machine learning methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms.

* Combining multiple predictors is not new
   - Bagging
   - Random forests
   - Gradient boosting
   
* However, these ensemble approaches combine common weak base learning algorithms (i.e. decision trees)  

* Stacking, on the other hand, is designed to .bold.blue[ensemble a diverse group of strong learners.]

# Super learner algorithm

Part 1: Set up the ensemble
- Specify a list of _L_ base learners (with a specific set of model parameters).
- Specify a metalearning algorithm. Can be any one of the algorithms discussed in the previous chapters but most often is regularized regression.

---
# Super learner algorithm

.opacity[Part 1: Set up the ensemble]

Part 2: Train the ensemble
- Train each of the _L_ base learners on the training set.
- Perform k-fold cross-validation on each of these learners and collect the cross-validated predicted values from each of the _L_ algorithms (must use the same k-folds for each base learner). These predicted values represent  `\(p_1,…,p_L\)`.
- The _N_ cross-validated predicted values from each of the _L_ algorithms can be combined to form a new `\(N \times L\)` matrix (represented by _Z_). This matrix, along with the original response vector (_y_), is called the “level-one” data. (N = number of rows in the training set.)



- Train the metalearning algorithm on the level-one data ( `\(y=f(Z)\)` ). The “ensemble model” consists of the __L__ base learning models and the metalearning model, which can then be used to generate predictions on a test set.

---
# Super learner algorithm

.opacity[Part 1: Set up the ensemble]

.opacity[Part 2: Train the ensemble]

Part 3: Predict on new data
- To generate ensemble predictions, first generate predictions from the base learners.
- Feed those predictions into the metalearner to generate the ensemble prediction.

.center.bold.font90[_Stacking rarely does worse than selecting the single best base learner on the training data. .blue[The biggest gains are usually produced when stacking base learners that have high variability, and uncorrelated, predicted values.] The more similar the predicted values, the less advantage there is in stacking._]

# Package implementation 📦
&lt;br&gt;
.font110[
* [h2o](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/stacked-ensembles.html): My go-to package for stacking and autoML. Provides three appraoches for model stacking.

* [SuperLearner](https://github.com/ecpolley/SuperLearner): original implementation, works with `caret` and many other algorithm packages.  Worth exploring.

* [subsemble](https://github.com/ledell/subsemble): developed by Erin Ledell who now is one of the developers of __h2o__. Maintained for backward compatibility but not forward development

* [caretEnsemble](https://github.com/zachmayer/caretEnsemble): implements a boostrapped (rather than cross-validated) version of stacking. The bootstrapped version will train faster since bootrapping (with a train/test) is a fraction of the work as k-fold cross-validation, however the the ensemble performance suffers as a result of this shortcut.

# Stacking existing models

.pull-left.font90[
Say we found the optimal hyperparameters that provided the best predictive accuracy for a:

1. Regularized regression base learner
2. Random forest base learner
3. Stochastic GBM base learner
4. XGBoost base learner

To stack them later we need to do a few specific things:

1. All models must be trained on the same training set.
2. All models must be trained with the same number of CV folds.
3. All models must use the same fold assignment to ensure the same observations are used (`fold_assignment = "Modulo"`).
4. The cross-validated predictions from all of the models must be preserved (`keep_cross_validation_predictions = True`).

* We can also stack multiple models generated from the same base learner

* Certain tuning parameters allow us to find unique patterns within the data

* By stacking the results of a grid search, we can capitalize on the benefits of each of the models in our grid search to create a meta model
